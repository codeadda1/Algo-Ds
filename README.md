## ALGORITHM AND DATA STRUCTURE

All algorithms implemented in c and C++ (for education)

### Contribution:
        
  -> Contributions are always welcome. implementation of algorithm and data structure in C and C++. 
  
  -> Just make sure you're implementing an algorithm.

  -> PRs are welcome. 

  -> Different and unique implementation of the algorithm are mostly welcomed.

  -> Please include a description for the algorithm that you are implementing. 
  
  -> It doesn't matter if it's copied from somewhere as long as it helps people that are learning new algorithm.

  -> Graphical examples would be very helpful too.
